DAIS‑10: Living Data — Professional Definition
In DAIS‑10, data becomes “living” when it continuously reflects the real‑time state, degradation, and operational drift of an asset. Living data is dynamic, time‑aware, self‑updating, and capable of revealing how risk evolves rather than how it looked at a single frozen moment.

"""Living data is not stored information — it is an active representation of the asset’s behaviour, health, and failure probability across time."""


How Data Becomes Alive (DAIS‑10 Perspective)
Data becomes “alive” when DAIS‑10 applies:

Time‑banded modelling (SIL(t), λ(t), PFDavg(t))

Continuous ingestion from sensors, CMMS, proof tests, and operational logs

Dynamic recalculation of risk, integrity, and degradation

Feedback loops that update models as the asset changes

Operational context (load, environment, maintenance gaps, human factors)

This transforms static engineering assumptions into real‑time operational truth.



Case Implementation Potential — Refineries, Processing Plants, Large Assets
DAIS‑10 can be deployed across:

1. Oil Refineries
Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS)

Emergency Shutdown (ESD)

Burner Management Systems (BMS)

Pressure Relief Networks

Rotating equipment (compressors, pumps, turbines)


2. Petrochemical and Gas Processing Plants
Fractionation columns

Reactors and reformers

Cryogenic units

Gas dehydration and sweetening systems


3. Large Industrial Assets
Pipelines

LNG terminals

Power generation units

Mining and mineral processing systems

In all these environments, DAIS‑10 converts raw operational data into living integrity models that track:

degradation

drift

failure probability

SIL(t) erosion

maintenance effectiveness

operational stress



How DAIS‑10 Saves Money

1. Eliminates Over‑Maintenance
Static standards assume worst‑case degradation.
DAIS‑10 shows actual degradation, allowing maintenance to be:

targeted

optimized

risk‑based

This reduces unnecessary shutdowns, proof tests, and part replacements.


2. Prevents Unplanned Outages
Living data detects drift early, preventing:

equipment failures

process upsets

emergency shutdowns

production losses


3. Extends Asset Life
By tracking real degradation, operators avoid premature replacements and extend asset lifespan.

How DAIS‑10 Saves Lives
1. Detects Safety Integrity Loss Before It Becomes Dangerous
Static SIL classifications hide time‑based erosion.
DAIS‑10 exposes:

sensor aging

valve stiction

proof test gaps

environmental stress

operational misuse

This prevents catastrophic failures.

2. Reduces Human Error
Living data provides:

real‑time alerts

clear risk visibility

automated integrity calculations

Operators no longer rely on outdated assumptions.

3. Strengthens Safety Culture
When risk becomes visible, measurable, and time‑dependent, decision‑making becomes:

proactive

evidence‑based

defensible

Lives are protected because the system no longer operates blind.

Executive‑Grade Summary
DAIS‑10 transforms industrial data into a living, time‑aware representation of asset integrity.
For refineries, processing plants, and large industrial assets, this means earlier detection of degradation, fewer failures, optimized maintenance, and a measurable reduction in both cost and risk.
Living data saves money by preventing outages and saves lives by exposing hidden integrity loss before it becomes catastrophic.
